**NeurIPS 2020 Presentation on Neural Programming Interfaces**: I'm happy to announce that the video and slides for the presentation I gave for NeurIPS 2020 on work done with fellow lab member Nathaniel Robinson and mentors Nancy Fulda and David Wingate regarding Neural Programming Interfaces (NPIs) are now accessible at the link below. Neural Programming Interfaces enable one to exercise very granular control over a pretrained neural network (in our case, GPT-2) with no need for specialized data (other than, for example, desirable and undesirable words/phrases) in the original domain of the pretrained network. \

**VOICE Summit 2018 Presentation Slides**: You can now view the slides for a presentation I gave with fellow lab member Will Meyers about our research related to the Amazon Alexa Prize 2018 social bot competition! In the presentation, we cover different methods for conducting automated open dialogue using knowledge graphs, word embeddings, and various neural network architectures. The questions raised by this research (and covered in the presentation) directly inspired my team's work on Neural Programming Interfaces two years later.\
