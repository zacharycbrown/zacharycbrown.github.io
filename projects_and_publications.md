### Projects

**Biosignal Feature Extraction**: My current project as a PhD student is aimed at developing optimal Self-Supervised Learning (Self-SL) algorithms for extracting useful features from neural Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings. Please see my public github repository []() where I've implemented several baseline algorithms as part of this project.

**Controlled Text Generation**: I recently lead a project to develope Neural Programming Interfaces (NPIs), in which we controlled a pretrained neural network (GPT-2) without any fine-tuning updates to the original model. We ultimately reduced need for specialized textual control data (beyond keyphrases) by 100% using a novel data curation approach, while simultaneously demonstrating large reductions in hate speech (87.2% fewer racial slurs and 88.6% fewer gender slurs) and increased desirable output (at 210% the rate of next-best baseline) generated by controlled GPT-2 models. Please see our publication _"Towards Neural Programming Interfaces"_ [Full Paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/c9f06bc7b46d0247a91c8fc665c13d0e-Paper.pdf) | [BibTex](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/c9f06bc7b46d0247a91c8fc665c13d0e-Bibtex.bib) for further details.
