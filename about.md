## About

### Current Position

I am currently performing research under Dr. David Carlson as a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University. My current project is focused on self-supervised learning and feature extraction for bio-electrical signals.

### Research Interests

I am passionate about explicitly controlling and regulating the outputs of deep learning systems, integrating formal knowledge representations with algorithmically trained architectures, and combining unsupervised learning with interpretable methods. My long-term research goals include developing machine learning systems to increase upward social mobility especially in terms of access to health care and education.

### Experience

I graduated with a BS in Applied Computational Mathematics from Brigham Young University in April 2020. Before matriculating as a PhD student, I had the opportunity to complete the second of two Data Engineering internships at Capital One (spanning the summers of 2019 and 2020), where I assisted in automating natural language processing tasks using Pytorch, AWS, Tensorflow, and other developer tools (see Resume/CV for details). I have been performing academic research for various labs (esp. the PCC and DRAGN Labs) since 2017, through which I have had the opportunity investigate topics ranging from common-sense knowledge extraction and knowledge representation (see Publications) to digital pathology.
